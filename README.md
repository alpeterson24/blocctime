Bloctime is a pomodoro clock application made with AngularJS and the Firebase API. Simply add a task and start the timer. Tasks are stored using Firebase. You can test out the app [here](http://pirate-parrot-27015.netlify.com/).

Under the pomodoro technique the clock will give you 25 minutes to work on a task, then a 5 minute break. This process will repeat four times and then the break will increase to 30 minutes, one time, and will then return back the 25 work + 5 minute break scheme. The process can be repeated as desired.
